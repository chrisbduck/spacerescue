Ludum Dare Brainstorming
------------------------

Theme: Tiny World (reckon I can use the plural though)

Ideas:

- Gravity space shooter thing with lots of asteroid-y mini planets
	- Objective could be to rescue people from them
	- Destroy the asteroids? or prevent destruction?
	- Power ups:
		- Short term shield
		- Double shots
		- Missiles with bigger explosions
		- Speed (accel power)
		- Armour
	- Hit points / armour / shields
		- Depleted by collision with anything above a set speed
	- Enemies
		- Gun placements
		- Slow hovering shooting ships
		- Kamikaze ships
		- Power up lasers
	- Non-stop gameplay
	- Hide the internals of the asteroids until approaching them
		- Later asteroids can have gun placements around the sides
	- Limited time per asteroid until the enemies launch reinforcements
	  to chase the player
	- I *like* this idea :)

- Platformer: lots of small levels
	- Space Quest-y sort of small stations to run through and do
	  something or other: maybe blow them up?


Sounds needed

- Player shoot - Player_Shoot
- Turret shoot - Turret_shootN (1-4)
- Player thruster - Thruster
- Player explosion - Big_Explosion
- Turret explosion - Explosion11, Explosion13
- For later:

	- Power up
